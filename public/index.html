        About the Kingdom
      </h2>
      <p>
        Colchis is located on the eastern shore of the Black Sea in what today
        makes up the western half of the country Georgia. People from this
        kingdom were known as Colchians. Much of the kingdom was built along the
        banks of the Phasis River (today the Rioni River). The mild climate of
        the Caucasus plus the extreme fertility of the region helped Colchis
        develop advanced agricultural techniques much earlier than the rest of
        Europe. From 1800 â€“ 1500 BC, Colchis was an urbanized center, reveling
        in Late Bronze Age advancements centuries before the Greeks. In
        particular, Colchians developed skillful metal working abilities. The
        bountiful harvest and skilled production of metal goods, combined with
        their seaside location, helped the Colchians become rich from trade.
